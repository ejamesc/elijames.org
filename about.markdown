#About Me

I am a writer, programmer, and occasional designer. I've done a couple of things I'm happy about.

I started [Novelr](http://www.novelr.com) in 2006, a blog on digital publishing. In its 6 year run, Novelr has been quoted by Business Insider, The Guardian, Daring Fireball and TechMeme. 

In 2010-2011 I co-founded and ran [Pandamian](http://pandamian.com), a digital publishing startup.

I spoke twice at Books in Browsers, a private conference for book technologists organized by the Internet Archive, in San Francisco. A transcript of the first talk may be found [here](http://www.novelr.com/2010/10/24/pandamian-a-publishing-support-layer); a video of the second is available [on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfsLORO7OAU). I am still working on many of the ideas in both talks.

In late 2011 I contributed [a chapter](http://book.pressbooks.com/chapter/web-literature-eli-james) to [Book: A Futurist's Manifesto](http://book.pressbooks.com/), a collection of essays on the future of publishing to be released by O'Reilly Media and Pressbooks in 2012. I'm rather happy with it: I consider it one of my better essays.

I try as much as possible to [write open source software](https://github.com/shadowsun7).

From mid-2010 - late-2012 I served as President of the [NUS Hackers](http://nushackers.org/). I started [Friday Hacks](http://nushackers.org/fridayhacks/) and ran the first Hack&Roll Hackathon. Whatever free time I have left is spent growing the community of hackers and builders in NUS. This mostly means setting up partnerships, organizing events, and writing software to make the club more scalable.

In a previous life, I played Judo for my state _(2008 National Championships; SUKMA shadow team)_. I also debated in school. Both sports have shaped the way I see the world.

I like Python, green tea and cats. I think vanilla ice cream is better than chocolate ice cream, and I will fight you on that.

I'm always interested in meeting people who are building cool things. Email me at ejames at pandamian.com
