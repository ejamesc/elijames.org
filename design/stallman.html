<h2>Richard Stallman in Singapore</h2>
<p>We hosted rms in Singapore in early 2012. My requirements: to design a series of posters that were striking enough to stand out on crowded university notice boards, while still appearing as part of the same talk series.</p>
<p>My solution was to use a solid background, with a different primary colour for each talk. Should Stallman choose to give a additional talk, all that would be necessary would be to change the copy and the background colour.</p>
<p>However, because this was rms, I had to do <em>everything</em> with free software: i.e. GIMP and the Ubuntu font family. I'm not sure I want to use GIMP ever again.</p>
