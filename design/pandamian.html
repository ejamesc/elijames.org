<h2>Pandamian</h2>
<p>I co-founded <a href='http://pandamian.com'>Pandamian</a> in 2010, and served as its designer and developer.</p>
<p>The premise behind Pandamian was that current ebook production workflows were painful, and writers would be better served with a web-based tool for producing their books. This turned out to be the wrong problem to solve (and, well, my co-founders and I were new to the game). We've since shut down the company.</p>
<p>Startup woes aside, Pandamian's interface was the result of an obsessive focus on simplicity. You're looking at the third iteration of Pandamian's UI; while the app did not succeed, we did get multiple happy reviews from users and educators who had been using the product.</p>
<p>
  <em>Pandamian was built with Django and Python.</em>
