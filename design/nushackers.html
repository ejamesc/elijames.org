<h2>NUS Hackers</h2>
<p>I designed and managed most of NUS Hackers's web properties from 2011 to 2013, in addition to my duties as President.</p>
<p>Chief amongst this was <a href='http://nushackers.org'>nushackers.org</a>, the primary web presence for the club. I kept visual styling to a minimum and focused on clear copywriting and content. We were trying to spread a fairly nuanced message (i.e. that hacking is good for Singapore!) so this website was necessary to establish and clarify that message.</p>
<p>This design has served us well over the course of 2 years, even as we've expanded our activities to include hackathons, workshops, and weekly talks.</p>
<p>
  <em>nushackers.org runs on Wordpress and uses a custom theme, designed and built over a weekend.</em>
