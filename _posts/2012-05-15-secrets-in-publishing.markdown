# Secrets in Publishing

<p>Peter Thiel&#8217;s latest CS183 class is about secrets. A 0-to-1 startup exists to find secrets (even one is enough) and execute on them. The best secrets are the ones that are both big and true. This is obvious, but worth saying: we sometimes limit ourselves to looking for small or false secrets.</p>

<p>Peter posits that there are two methods to finding secrets: the first way is to work things out for yourself, which is what scientists do. The second way is to look at what people are <em>not</em> talking about. The second way is slightly more applicable to &#8216;people secrets&#8217; (economics; business opportunities), as opposed to &#8216;nature secrets&#8217; (chemistry, physics). The second way is usually easier.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/22866240816/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-11-notes-essay">rest of the argument</a> he makes is long and well-constructed; you should probably read it for yourself.  </p>

<p>But I want to examine his idea that the best secrets are the ones people don&#8217;t want to talk about. If this is true, what secrets exist in publishing?</p>

<p>I can think of one: that books are going to die.</p>

<p>Not true death, of course. I would probably be more accurate if I&#8217;d phrased the sentence as &#8216;books are going the way of the record player and radio&#8217;. People in publishing &#8212; myself included &#8212; shy away from the topic whenever it comes up (which is rarely) in publishing talks or conferences. Even on the Reading2.0 mailing list, nobody talks much about the slow, long decline of books. We talk about the issues surrounding that instead.</p>

<p>What are the replacements for books going to look like? Well, we <em>do </em>have some idea as to what they could look like. Some people thought that multimedian books were the future - companies like Vook, for instance, started making video-books with that premise. They and many others have failed, and I think we can use their experience as an analog for the book future: multimedian books are currently unlikely to cause the death of the book. We already have TV shows and video games for that.</p>

<p>Rather, I suspect that books are going to become shorter. Not novella-shorter, but radically short: short story or essay-length shorter. Seth Godin pointed out a few years back that business blogs have made business books obsolete. There is nothing that you cannot express as a business book that you can also express as a business blog.</p>

<p>I think this will be true for novels. Sure, there will always be a subsection of the population who will read books. But as it is today, this subsection will be a minority of the population. Books are no longer the cultural drivers of our world. Young people do read, but they spend most of their reading online: blog posts, news articles and long-form essays. And other things like music, movies, and video games have overtaken books as cultural landmarks.</p>

<p>I have three hypotheses that I would like to test: that 1) people are going to want shorter pieces to read 2) on-the-go, and 3) these habits will shape the books of the future.</p>
