<h3><em>Eli James is a nom-de-plume</em></h3>
<p>My real name's Cedric Chin. I started using Eli as an alias because I began doing digital publishing work at a <em>really</em> young age. Using a nom-de-plume allowed my ideas to be evaluated independent of my background. I thought back then &mdash; and still think now &mdash; that this was incredibly cool. I've been in love with the Internet since.</p>

<p>The name stuck. Eli James is now associated with most of my work (and therefore: most of my digital life).</p>

<p>Feel free to call me with whichever name you please &mdash; I respond comfortably to both.</p>
