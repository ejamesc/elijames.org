      A macho young swimmer named Dwyer,
        Really liked playing with fire.
        One night in the dark
        He swam with a shark,
        And his voice is now two octaves higher.*/

          <h1>Tembusu's Crash a Class Week</h1>
          <p class='lead'>When you were in high school, you had some idea as to what everybody else was studying. But in university, this is no longer true.</p>

<p>For instance: do you have any idea what your friends in math are studying now? (Hint: they're no longer solving computation problems). Or your friends in philosophy? Physics? Theatre? Computer science?</p>

<p><strong>This sem, we're doing Crash a Class Week.</strong> Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>This week</strong> - you list out classes you're taking now that you think would be cool for your friends to crash.</li>
  <li><strong>Next week</strong> - you and your friends crash each others classes! <strong>(Happening now!)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions!</h3>
     <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong></p>
     <p>This is for Tembusians.</p>

     <p><strong>I want to list a class! How do I do that?</strong></p>
     <p>Go to this <a href='https://docs.google.com/a/pandamian.com/document/d/1ljXei-yI6CrHO5ZHJMJIfpMcqOS3Q6-bThv4Df4ZCuE/edit'>link</a>, and list your class (more instructions there)! We'll then contact you via email to let you know who would be crashing your class with you, and provide you with their contact details. This happens on Sunday (27th January 2013).</p>

     <p><strong>I want to sign up for a crash! How do I do that?</strong></p>
     <p>We freeze the list of classes on Friday, and then we'll do another Facebook post with a link to list of classes and a sign-up form!</p>

      <p><strong>Why should I go?</strong></p>
      <p>For fun! To satisfy your intellectual curiousity! <strike>To stalk people in other faculties!</strike></p> 
      <p>But, more seriously: university is the last time you can explore different alternative fields with such ease. (Try doing this after you graduate, for instance ;-) Let's make the most of it! </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I think this is discriminatory against people who don't have friends!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Well, we can be friends!</p>
